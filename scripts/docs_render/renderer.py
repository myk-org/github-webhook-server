"""Static markdown -> HTML renderer for the documentation site.

Vendored verbatim (modulo the adaptations below) from ``myk-org/docsfy``
(``src/docsfy/renderer.py``) so this repo can rebuild ``docs/`` on its own,
without depending on the external docsfy clone at runtime. Only the
deterministic rendering half was taken: no AI generation, no network, no
``docsfy`` package imports. The docsfy images pipeline (``copy_images_to_site``)
is not vendored because this repo ships no ``docsfy-images/`` source.

Upstream behaviour is preserved, including the "Generated with docsfy" badge,
which keeps working via the ``docsfy_repo_url`` template variable.

It is a vendored copy, so local modifications are expected. The local
deviations are ``_indent_fenced_blocks`` (see its docstring, ``llms-full.txt``
only) and the parser-based ``_sanitize_html`` allowlist (upstream ships a
regex stripper that had four separate bypasses); everything else is
byte-identical to upstream.
